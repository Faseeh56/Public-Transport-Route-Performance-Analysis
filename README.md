## Project Title

Public Transport Route Performance Analysis

## Description

This project evaluates the operational performance of public transport routes by analyzing passenger demand, route delays, and scheduling efficiency to improve service reliability.

## Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

## Key Analysis

Passenger demand by city and time slot

Route congestion analysis

Delay distribution and efficiency ratios

Passenger count vs delay correlation

## Key Insights

Morning and evening time slots have the highest passenger demand.

Certain routes are consistently overcrowded.

Delays increase during peak hours due to congestion.

## Recommendations

Increase vehicle frequency on high-demand routes.

Optimize schedules to reduce delays.

Introduce express services on crowded routes.
